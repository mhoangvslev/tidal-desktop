# TIDAL for Linux

## What is this?

This is a wrapper for TIDAL's web app, using Nativfier, which injects custom code to provide for a better desktop experience. It adds the following features to TIDAL:

- Close to tray
- Global keyboard shortcuts (by default, bound to media keys)
- Desktop Notifications

## Installation

### From binary

### FAQ

#### Why Electron!? Electron is garbage! I want a native app!

To be honest, same, but, I don't have the time (this entire thing took about an hour or two to get working). This method of injecting code is far easier to get working, and, at the end of the day, works.

#### Can I disable notifications?

Not through an option in the interface, no. However, you can open up `resources/app/inject/inject.js`, and change the option `enable_notifications` to `False`. If you want this to be persistent across builds, change this in `custom.js`.

#### How do I change the shortcuts from media keys?

If you want to change the keyboard shortcuts, open up `resources/app/nativefier.json`, and scroll down to `"globalShortcuts"`, and modify it as needed. Make sure you only change `"key"` not `"inputEvents"`, or your keys will fail to register inside TIDAL. To make this persistent across new builds, instead modify `shortcuts.json`, and run `npm run build` - the new binary will use your new keybinds.

#### Are you sure there isn't a better way than this mess?

There *kind of* is (if you're okay with more Electron that is). Plex added support for TIDAL, all proper like, and their desktop apps also support it (however seem to be Electron powered, or at least, Plexamp is). If you link a Plex account to your TIDAL account, you don't actually need a Plex server to use TIDAL (last time I checked anyway). This is here for those who don't want to use Plex, or want easy access to the features Plex doesn't have *just* yet, like Mixes or Discovery features.
